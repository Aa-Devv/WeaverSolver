# WeaverSolver
Weaver is an online game avaliable through the website https://wordwormdormdork.com/
It uses a list of English words of 4 letters each, in a game where the player is presented with two words. The goal of the game is to transform the first word into the second word. The rules are 1) You can only change one letter at a time. 2) The letter that you change can't make the word fall outside of the aforementioned 4 letters word list. This program gives you one of the optimal solutions for every two words the you give it.
